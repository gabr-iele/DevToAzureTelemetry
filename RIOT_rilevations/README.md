**HW2: Rilevations from RIOT-OS simulated device and from real device (iot-lab)**

**Goal**: Implement a RIOT-OS application to publish simulated values through MQTT-SN protocol and a transparent bridge to the broker of the cloud infrastructure of the previous assingment, and readapt it in order to retrieve values from real sensors using the hardware provided by IoT-Lab Testbed Facility ([M3 Nodes](https://www.iot-lab.info/hardware/m3/)).
