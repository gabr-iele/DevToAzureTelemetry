**HW3: Connection of RIOT-OS node and cloud-based backend broker through LoRaWAN protocol (The Things Network)**

**Goal**: Insertion of LoRaWAN protocol in the communication between the nodes and the gateway through TTN and deployment on real hardware provided by IoT-Lab Testbed Facility ([B-L072Z-LRWAN1 LoRa kit](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l072z-lrwan1.html)).

**HW2: Rilevations from RIOT-OS simulated device and from real device (iot-lab)**

**Goal**: Implement a RIOT-OS application to publish simulated values through MQTT-SN protocol and a transparent bridge to the broker of the cloud infrastructure of the previous assingment, and readapt it in order to retrieve values from real sensors using the hardware provided by IoT-Lab Testbed Facility ([M3 Nodes](https://www.iot-lab.info/hardware/m3/)).

**HW1: Random rilevations from virtual device (python)**

**Goal**: Generate random values simulating the behavior of an environmental station, publish them through the MQTT protocol to the built-in broker of a cloud-based backend (Azure IoT), implement persistency of received data and visualize them on a website.

**How to test**:

1) Fill the variable <code>storageSharedAccessKey</code> in the <code>/web/script.js</code> file and the variable <code>hubSharedAccessKey</code> in the <code>/main/sensors.py</code> file with appropriate values
2) Open a terminal in <code>/main</code> folder and run <code>python sensors.py</code> to start sending telemetry data to the Hub
3) Open the <code>index.html</code> file in the <code>/web</code> folder to execute query operations

**IMPORTANT**: in order to work, the application needs two secret keys to access the Hub and the Storage. In this repository they're omitted for security reasons.
